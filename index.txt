            <h2>Research Question</h2>
            <p><strong>"What were the key experiences that shaped your decision to apply to and attend Texas Tech?"</strong></p>
            
            <h3>About This Study</h3>
            <p>This research explores the decision-making process of incoming freshmen at Texas Tech University. Through in-depth interviews, we examined the factors, experiences, and influences that led students to choose Texas Tech as their educational home.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Themes Explored</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Awareness:</strong> When and how students first learned about Texas Tech</li>
                <li><strong>Influencing Factors:</strong> People, programs, and experiences that shaped their decision</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Considerations:</strong> The role of program reputation, funding, and career outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> How scholarships and ROI influenced college choice</li>
                <li><strong>Campus Culture:</strong> Expectations vs. reality of life at Tech and in Lubbock</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Growth:</strong> Reflections on the transition to college life</li>
